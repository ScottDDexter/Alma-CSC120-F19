  <h2>Lab 1: Hands Onto Keybaords</h2>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Open <code>jGRASP</code> and explore what it can do (even if we haven't talked about all that stuff yet)</li>
    <li>Type and run a very simple Java program.</li>
    <li>Explore various kinds of "typos" and their effect on Java programs.</li>
    <li>Begin to explore various kinds of "errors" and what they tell us about our program.</li>
    <li>(Also, relax about the rather scary-sounding term "error"&mdash;maybe think of some alternative wording for your mental purposes.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This lab really focuses on ideas discussed in sections 1.1 through 1.3 of the text. Review those before you come to class, and consider having the book open as you're working, so you can map what you're doing and experiencing to the book's discussion.</p>

  <p>This lab should be done by each of you, on your own computer, though of course you can discuss with me and your classmates.</p>

  <h3>Part I: Guided Tour and Demo</h3>

  <p>Let's get jGRASP running together, and I'll show you around. Make sure you see how the "software tools" discussed in Section 1.2 show up in jGRASP&mdash;we're not going to make use of everything right away, but it's usually easier to start using a new piece of software if you know roughly how it's organized. Keep your eyes out especially for the <i>editor</i>, <i>compiler</i>, <i>debugger</i>, and visualizing tools.</p>

  <h3>Part II: Using jGRASP</h3>

  <p>Let's start with Programming Projects 1.1 and 1.2 at the end of Chapter 1. I'll give you a simple paper worksheet to support PP 1.2&mdash;for each part of the exercise, be sure to write down your <i>prediction</i> of what will happen before you make each change, then write down what actually happened. Don't cheat yourself out of the prediction step! The goal is <em>not</em> to predict things correctly but to <em>understand</em> why things didn't happen as you predict. You will be spending a LOT of time responding to "error messages," so this is a valuable opportunity to play around. If you get the eight cases in the assignment done, feel free to continue making other changes and trying to predict the result.</p>

  <p>Using Listing 1.1 as a general template, do PP 1.4. You're "done" when the program runs and gives the output you want. As you work, <strong>make a note</strong> of each time you compile and run the program&mdash;were you happy with the outcome? why not? (It's <i>possible</i> that you'll only need to compile and run once, and everything will be perfect the first time. But for most of us, even a simple program takes a few tries before we're happy with the result. Be prepared to discuss what your notes show (but I won't ask you to turn them in.)</p>


  <h3>Part III: Reflection</h3>
  <p>By 5pm Friday, <strong>upload a reflection</strong> on today's lab to Moodle. How did your learning advance today (if at all)? Did any concepts become clearer today? Was this first lab more or less fun/exciting/nerve-wracking than you expected? What was the most interesting part of the lab for you? (Admittedly, we're just getting started, so most likely nothing mind-blowing has happened yet.) Did anything get <em>more</em> confusing? (This is perfectly normal.) What questions do you have after today?</p>

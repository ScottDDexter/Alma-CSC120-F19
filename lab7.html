  <h2>Lab 7: Lightning Loop Lab</h2>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>

  <p>In this lab, I'm going to give you a lot of "infrastructure" for some loop problems; you'll write the loops that make it all go. Do as many as you can before the end of lab&mdash; no "lab homework" this week cuz you have a project to finish. Of course, you don't have to work on these in the order they're presented.</p>


<h3>1. Compute Pay</h3>

  <p>The input consists of data for several workers. For each worker, the data consists of his or her name (a string that may include embedded blanks), title (a string that may include embedded blanks), wage (a floating-point value) and the number of hours he or she worked (an integer). The program must calculate each worker’s gross pay (wage times hours) and print it along with the worker’s name and title.</p>

  <p>Sample Input:</p>
  <pre>Herb Green, Programmer, 12.5, 40</pre>

  <p>Sample Output:</p>
  <pre>Pay $480.00 to Herb Green, Programmer</pre>

  <h3>2. Golf Scores</h3>

  <p>For this program, the input contains exactly 18 lines (one for each hole on a golf course). Each line contains 5 values: the first is the par for the hole; the remaining values are the scores (number of strokes) for each of four golfers (A, B, C, and D). Compute each golfer's score (which is the number of strokes they took minus par, summed over all holes). Print out all 4 golfer's scores and identify the winner.</p>


  <h3>3. More Vowels, Really?</h3>

  <p>Here, the input is a single string from the user (which could contain spaces). Read in this string, then print out the number of times each vowel appears in the string ('y' is not a vowel for our purposes today).</p>

  <h3>4. Scooped Out Square</h3>

  <p>Here the input is two integers. The first must be between 1 and 40 (inclusive); the second must be between 0 and the second number (inclusive). The first number is the dimension of a square; the second number is the dimenion of a second 'hollow' square in the center of the first. Your program should draw the specified shape. For example, if the input is <code>9 3</code>, you should produce</p>

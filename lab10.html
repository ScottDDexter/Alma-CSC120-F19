  <h2>Lab10: Swing</h2>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>To become acquainted with the Eclipse IDE.</li>
    <li>To practice modifying and extending existing Swing code.</li>
    <li>To become familiar with writing both event-handling and graphics code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>In today's lab, we'll "switch" to Eclipse (you won't be <em>required</em> to use Eclipse after today, but if you are considering taking CSC 121 it would be a good idea for you to use this time to get used to Eclipse). I'll show you the basics of "getting around" in Eclipse (which is not too too different from jGRASP), and then you'll get to work on today's programming work.</p>

  <p>In particular, we'll look the Chapter 5 code for Coin/CountFlips and the Triangle and its drivers. Nothing new in terms of Java behavior, but we'll see how Eclipse does the things we know from jGRASP (and a few more useful things, especially the idea of 'projects').</p>

  <p>Once we have that sorted, you'll work on three small Eclipse projects.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First, do PP 6.4, which is a small modification of the <code>Fahrenheit</code> program we've discussed in class. Write as little new code as possible! (<a href="Fahrenheit/src/Fahrenheit.java">Fahrenheit.java</a>&nbsp; <a href="Fahrenheit/src/FahrenheitPanel.java">FahrenheitPanel.java</a>)</p>


<li>Then let's "finish the story" from Wednesday's class, when we added a text field for the font size. Here are the Java source files we need; we'll import them into an Eclipse project: <a href="StyleOptions/src/StyleOptions.java">StyleOptions.java</a>&nbsp;<a href="StyleOptions/src/StyleOptionsPanel.java">StyleOptionsPanel.java</a>


<li>  <p>Finally, do PP 6.10, which changes its background depending on horizontal mouse position.  For this part, create a new Eclipse project from scratch (you might, of course, copy-n-paste some of the general Swing code from other projects). It's a little tricky to tell from the code listings in the book, but the method you want to implement to handle  mouse movement is </p>
  <p>  <code>public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent event)</code></p>
  <p>You'll want to look at the example code and discussion in 6.4 to get a sense of how to do this. For extra credit, implement a "gradient" in which the background color changes smoothly from red to green as the mouse moves across the screen.</p>
</ol>

<p>Turn in your Eclipse projects for 1 and 3. To do this (I'll show you in class), go to the File menu and pick "Export..." Under the "General" section, pick "Archive File." You'll need to give your file a name (doesn't really matter what), and then hit "Browse..." to indicate where to put it (I recommend putting the file on the Desktop so you can easily drag it into Moodle to submit.)</p>

  <h2>Lab 4: References, Objects and Interactions in jGRASP</h2>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Use jGRASP as a "scratchpad" to study the behavior of small chunks of code.</li>
        <li>Use jGRASP to view the state of objects (such as <code>String</code>s) as a program executes.</li>
        <li>Explore "wrapper" classes and enumerated types&mdash;get a sense of what these strange objects look like.</li>
        <li>Explore the "utility" classes presented in Chapter 3, consider different approaches to solving a problem.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Part I: Interactions</h3>

    <p>We can use jGRASP to create program fragments to check our logic, or just experiment&mdash;without having to write a full Java program. We'll look at the "interactions" tab and how it interacts with the workbench and canvas/viewer system.</p>

    <h3>Part II: <code>Math</code> and <code>Random</code></h3>

  <p>Fortunately, 'i' is no longer an illegal vowel. But unfortunately, you are now the administrator of the District 12 lottery. Every day, you must generate a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive). You then allow five people to buy a lottery ticket; they must let the lottery machine pick their play. If a ticket matches the daily pick, the holder gets a  $5 jackpot (yes, if there are multiple winning tickerts, you're in the hole. I told you this was an unfortunate situation...). As administrator, you are not only interested in making sure jackpots are paid, but you also want to make sure that the general behavior of the system is working in your favor. Thus, every day, you calculate the mean and standard deviation of the randomly chosen ticket values. Write a short program that "runs" a day: it picks the winning number, it prints five random tickets, it determines the day's payout, and reports the mean and standard deviation of the picks.</p>

  <p>By the way, the mean of <i>n</i> numbers (in case you didn't know) is the sum of the numbers divided by <i>n</i> (in our case, yes, five). The standard deviation is easily calculated once you know the mean: find each number's difference from the mean, square that difference, sum those squares, divide by <i>n-1</i>, and take the square root (if you prefer a formuler, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=standard+deviation">this</a> should turn one up). Your program should print doubles with no more than 2 numbers after the decimal point.</>

    <h3>Part III: some more inspection</h3>

<p>Don't delete that code! (In fact, submit it!) By the way, did you do all the things? You know, like avoiding magic numbers, indenting, maybe even writing a few comments? OK, good.</p>

<h3>Part IV: wrappers and enumerated types</h3>

<p>As far as I can tell, the book doesn't really make use of enumerated types at any point after Chapter 3. So we'll just look quickly at them for now&mdash;it's possible they'll come in handy for a later project, but until then, they're not super-interesting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the wrapper classes have some interesting behavior, so we'll look quickly at those. In particular, it's important to understand what <i>autoboxing</i> and <i>unboxing</i> are (and do).</p>

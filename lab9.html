  <h2>Lab 9: Testing and Debugging</h2>

  <h3>Objectives:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Understand the difference between black-box and white-box texting.</li>
    <li>Design black-box tests for a given problem.</li>
    <li>Design white-box tests for a given piece of code.</li>
    <li>Implement a simple "test driver" for some unit testing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>As the book says, "black box" testing is when we devise tests based on the <i>expected behavior</i> of our code (we don't have any information about how the code is implemented&mdash;we don't know what's in the box). "White box" (or "glass box") testing is only possible when we <i>do</i> have access to the implementation: we can use that code to structure our tests, with the goal of making sure that all the code is "exercised" by the test.

    <h3>Part 2: Black Box Testing</h3>

  <p>Write some black box tests for the two problems below. For the purposes of the assignment, write each test on line, formatted like this:</p>

  <p><code>[input values]  [correct result] [comment on 'purpose' of test]</code></p>

  <p>For example (for the FizzBuzz problem):</p>

  <p><code>4 4 behavior on even numbers</code></p>

  <h4>Testing: FizzBuzz</h4>

  <p>There's a famous problem in the programming world called <strong>FizzBuzz</strong>. It's a simple problem: print out the numbers from 1 to 100, but everytime you hit a number divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead. Every time you hit a number divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead. If you hit a number divisible by 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz." Imagine your colleague has written a method <code>public String fizzBuzzer(int x)</code>, which returns <code>"-"</code> if <code>x</code> is less than 1, and the string that FizzBuzz should print for <code>x</code>. Write a sequence of tests for the fizzBuzzer method.</p>

  <h4>Testing: Supermarket</h4>

  <p>Supermarket pricing can be tricky: some items have fixed prices, some have special prices if you buy multiples. For example, if a market is selling A, B, C, and D products, they might have pricing rules like this:

    <pre>
  Item   Unit      Special
         Price     Price
  --------------------------
    A     50       3 for 130
    B     30       2 for 45
    C     20
    D     15</pre>

   <p>Our checkout system can accept items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we’ll recognize the two B’s and price them at 45 (for a total price so far of 95).</p>

  <p>Suppose we have a <code>scan</code> method that takes in a String representing a sequence of products (like <code>"BAB"</code> and returns an int representing the total price of those products). Write a sequence of tests for this method.</p>

  <h3>Part 3: Test Drivers</h3>

  <p>Testing only works well if it's highly automated. For this final part of the lab, I'll show you a test driver for the Triangle class isIsosceles method, and you'll add testing code for isEquilateral and longestSide. <a href="Triangle.class">Here is a Triangle class</a> (but not the source code!) to test. Based on your testing, what seems to be going on with this class?</p>

  <h3>Submission</h3>

  <p>For this lab, submit a text file containing (1) your sequence of tests for fizzBuzzer, (2) your sequence of tests for scan, (3) your diagnosis of the Triangle class you tested. Which tests were most helpful to your diagnosis? Also submit your completed TriangleTestDriver.java file.</p>
